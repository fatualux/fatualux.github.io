My current profession has nothing to do with IT, but my current passions are closely linked to this sector.

I like finding solutions to automate repetitive workflows, best configuring the technological tools I work with and using creativity to find innovative solutions or create content.

My main interests in this field are the following:
- Exploration and study of open source tools and technologies
- Creation of multimedia content
- Production of manuals or tutorials in order to share the skills acquired
- Configuration and customization of IT tools
