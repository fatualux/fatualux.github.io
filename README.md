# Docker Nicola

Simplest Docker image for building a static website with [Nikola](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola).

You only need a bash-compatible shell.

Clone this repository, and put it in a directory containing a Nikola site.

- To view Nikola's help page, run:
```
sh nikola.sh
```

To build the site, run:
```
sh build.sh

```

To build and serve a site, automatically detecting site changes, run:
```
sh serve.sh
```

Done!
